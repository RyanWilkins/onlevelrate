On Level Rate Calculator Dashboard Functions

See the final app in action at [My Portfolio](http://www.rjwilkins.com/project/onlevelrate/)

This d3.js based visualization combines front end JavaScript with back end Django framework to create a browser application for calculating On Level Rate Change factors, as described in Werner and Modlin. Actuaries use these calculations in predicting future claims rates and often use Excel based methods. This app explores the possibility of an alternative cloud based, completely customizable solution.
